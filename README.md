# GDPR
This is the repository for the tool I created to analyze the compliance of input text with GDPR guidelines.
The file that has to be run is called "GDPR Grammerly_Cleaned.py." It would be best to download the directory and open the py file in Spyder or Thonny.
Necessary libraries to download include pandas, sklearn, nltk, and tkinter.
