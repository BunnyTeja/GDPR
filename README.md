# GDPR
This is the repository for the tool I created to analyze the compliance of input text with GDPR guidelines.
The file that has to be run is called "GDPR Grammerly_Cleaned.py." It would be best to download the directory and open the py file in Spyder or Thonny.
Necessary libraries to download include pandas, sklearn, nltk, and tkinter.


Steps to Run the project

Download the code and go to the project directory through cmd prompt.
Install the following libraries pandas, sklearn, nltk, and openpyxl(pip install openpyxl)
Go to the main program directory and Run the project(python GDPRGrammerly.py)
